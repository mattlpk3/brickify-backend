        user_input = f"""
Render a 3D LEGO-style avatar of a real person based on their face. The figure must have a yellow LEGO-style head, hands, and body with strong facial resemblance to the person.

Pose the figure in a dynamic LEGO-style position based on this input: {pose}.

Place the figure inside a bold red LEGO-style brick box that looks like an official LEGO product box. The box must be fully 3D, include realistic LEGO-style brick studs on the top, and appear slightly angled to show depth.

On the top front of the box, show the word "BRICKIFY" in large bold LEGO-style yellow text.

Directly underneath that, display these icons in this exact order â€” small, centered, and spaced evenly: @ symbol, Instagram logo, TikTok logo, and X (Twitter) logo.

The internal background scene inside the box must be: {background}.

At the bottom of the box, include a yellow LEGO-style nameplate that says: {phrase}, using a bold font that matches the LEGO aesthetic.

Surrounding the entire brick box and figure, make sure there is a fully transparent background â€” do not include shadows or external scenery. The box must float cleanly on a transparent canvas.

The image must resemble a high-quality LEGO product render with accurate depth, lighting, and 3D form.

Background: {background}  
Pose or Accessory: {pose}  
Name or Phrase: {phrase}
