Pose the figure in a dynamic way based on the input provided. Place it inside a LEGO-style 3D red brick box with a transparent background and a {background} scene. The top of the box must say 'BRICKIFY' in a bold LEGO-style font. Directly underneath, show these icons in this exact order: @ symbol, Instagram logo, TikTok logo, X (Twitter) logo â€” small and clean. At the bottom, show a yellow LEGO-style nameplate with the following name or phrase: {phrase}. The box must include 3D brick studs on top and feel like a real LEGO box and around it should be transparent background if possible. Style must remain consistent, professional, and unique to BRICKIFY.
